## 🔄 How Data Flows

- User opens SaveQuest frontend
- Clicks **Connect Bank** → triggers Plaid Link
- Plaid returns a `public_token` → sent to backend
- Backend exchanges token for permanent access token, fetches transactions, analyzes merchant/category, updates Firestore (challenges, streaks, savings)
- Frontend reads data from backend API, animates progress, displays leaderboards
- Notifications sent via Firebase Cloud Messaging

---

## 📦 Database Layer

Firestore collections:

```
users
  - userId
    email
    totalSavings
    XP

challenges
  - challengeId
    name
    rules
    dailyPledge

userChallenges
  - composite key (userId_challengeId)
    streak
    status

transactions
  - txnId
    userId
    merchantName
    amount
    category
```

## 💸 Estimated Dev Stack Costs (MVP)

| Service            | Cost                                   |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------------- |
| Vercel free tier   | \$0                                    |
| Render free tier   | \$0                                    |
| Firebase free tier | \$0 (within limits)                    |
| Plaid sandbox      | \$0                                    |
| Plaid production   | \~\$500/mo starting (depends on usage) |

✅ **So your MVP can run for free, except Plaid fees once you go live.**

---

## ⭐ Why This Architecture Rocks

✅ Node.js backend = lightweight & fast  
✅ Frontend + backend both JavaScript = same language stack  
✅ Firestore = serverless, scalable, real-time  
✅ Plaid = secure bank data integration  
✅ Cloud hosting = cheap or free for MVP

---

## 🎯 Why SaveQuest?

Most people want to save money, but find it boring or hard. SaveQuest makes saving exciting by turning it into a game — with challenges, streaks, and rewards — so you build good habits and reach your goals faster.

---

## How SaveQuest Works

1. **Pick a Challenge**
   - e.g. “No Starbucks Week”, “No Uber rides for 10 days”, “Spend \$0 this weekend”
2. **Set Your Pledge**
   - Decide how much to save each time you succeed (e.g. “I’ll save \$5 every day I skip Starbucks.”)
3. **Connect Your Bank Account**
   - Securely link your bank using Plaid; SaveQuest reads your real transactions (with permission).
4. **Track Your Spending Automatically**
   - Each day, SaveQuest checks your transactions:
   - If you didn’t spend at the challenge merchant → streak goes up!
   - If you did spend → streak resets.
5. **Get Rewarded**
   - Complete a challenge to move your pledged savings into your “savings pot”, earn XP, and spin a bonus wheel.
6. **See Your Progress**
   - Dashboard shows total saved, current streaks, XP level, and leaderboards.

---

**TL;DR:**  
SaveQuest uses real bank data to check if you kept your spending promises, and turns saving money into a fun, gamified experience.

---

# ✅ **What SaveQuest Does NOT Do**

❌ It **doesn’t directly move your money** between banks (for now).  
❌ It **doesn’t invest your money.**  
❌ It **never takes money without your permission.**

---

# ✅ **Plaid Integration**

* Plaid Link widget launches in frontend
* Frontend sends `public_token` → backend
* Backend exchanges token → stores Plaid `access_token`
* Periodic fetch of transactions
* Webhooks for:
  * New transactions
  * Errors

---

# ✅ **Notifications Layer**

* Firebase Cloud Messaging sends:
  * “Don’t forget today’s challenge!”
  * “You finished No Starbucks Week! 🎉”

---

# ✅ **Hosting Overview**

| Layer         | Hosting                       |
| ------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Frontend      | Vercel                        |
| Backend       | Render, Railway, or Cloud Run |
| Firestore     | Firebase (GCP-managed)        |
| Plaid API     | Hosted by Plaid               |
| Notifications | Firebase Cloud Messaging      |

---

## ✅ **Scalability Plan**

* Backend → stateless → horizontal scaling
* Firestore auto-scales
* Plaid handles millions of transactions
* Frontend → globally distributed via Vercel

---

**TL;DR:**  
→ SaveQuest uses React frontend + Node.js backend + Firestore DB + Plaid.  
→ Everything fits in a modern, cloud-native architecture ready for MVP and scale.
